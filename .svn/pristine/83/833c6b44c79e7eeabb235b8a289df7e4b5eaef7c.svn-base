 * Enter a column (zero-based indexing) to append disk to.
 * Hitting reset resets the singleton model and consequently
 * de-registers any registered listener. As reset is not supported
 * once the game begins (until game ends or has been won), the button
 * will be disabled once the required number of players for a mode have
 * registered.
 * 
 * Game auto-begins once required number of players have registered.
 * Game auto-resets after it is over. 
 * 
 * All messages and alerts (if any) are displayed at the top of the screen,
 * above the game frame.
 * 
 * First player - Yellow. Second player/Computer - Red.
 * 
 * Default game has 7 columns. To alter number of columns, please check
 * GameModel.getGameModel(Mode, NumberOfColumns).
 * 
 * Please enter your column number in the text box. Do not click
 * on any cell in the table.
